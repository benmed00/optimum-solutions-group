## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Required Actions

#### 1. Set up GitHub Secrets
**Status: ⏳ REQUIRED**

You need to configure the following secret in your GitHub repository:

```
Repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
```

| Secret Name | Description | Status |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` | Your Slack webhook URL | ⏳ **REQUIRED** |

**Alternative**: If you don't want Slack notifications, you can remove the `notify` job from `.github/workflows/performance-monitoring.yml`

#### 2. Test Workflow Components Locally
**Status: ✅ READY**

Run the local test suite to verify everything works:

```bash
npm run test:workflow
```

This will test all the main workflow components locally before pushing.

#### 3. Push Changes
**Status: ✅ READY**

Your changes are committed and ready to push:

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Optional Enhancements

#### GitHub Pages Setup (Optional)
If you want the performance dashboard to be deployed to GitHub Pages:

1. Go to Repository → Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. The workflow will automatically deploy to `https://yourusername.github.io/optimum-solutions-group/`

#### Additional Monitoring (Optional)
Consider setting up additional monitoring:
- Performance budgets in the bundle analyzer
- Custom thresholds for Core Web Vitals
- Integration with external monitoring services

## 🔧 Workflow Overview

Once deployed, your GitHub Actions workflow will:

1. **Performance Audit** 
   - Run Lighthouse tests
   - Generate performance reports
   - Upload artifacts

2. **Accessibility Audit**
   - Run axe-core tests
   - Run pa11y tests  
   - Upload accessibility reports

3. **Bundle Analysis**
   - Analyze bundle sizes
   - Generate HTML and JSON reports
   - Check size limits

4. **Dashboard Generation**
   - Aggregate all reports
   - Generate dashboard data
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages (if enabled)

5. **Notifications**
   - Send Slack alerts on failures (if configured)
   - Send success notifications for scheduled runs

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after deployment:

### Common Issues

**❌ Workflow fails with "Specify secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"**
- Set the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret in GitHub
- OR remove the notify job from the workflow

**❌ Bundle analysis job fails**
- Check that the build completes successfully
- Verify `analyze:bundle` script runs locally

**❌ Dashboard generation fails**
- Check that performance reports are being generated
- Verify glob dependency is properly installed

### Getting Help

1. Check the workflow logs in GitHub Actions tab
2. Run `npm run test:workflow` locally to diagnose issues
3. Review the `GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions

## 📊 Expected Results

Once everything is working, you should see:

- ✅ All workflow jobs complete successfully
- 📊 Performance reports uploaded as artifacts
- 📈 Bundle analysis reports generated
- 🏠 Dashboard deployed to GitHub Pages (if enabled)
- 📱 Slack notifications (if configured)

## 🎯 Ready to Deploy!

**Current Status: ✅ READY** (pending Slack secret setup)

You can now safely push your changes. The workflow should run successfully after you:

1. Set up the `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` secret (or remove Slack notifications)
2. Push your changes: `git push origin main`
3. Monitor the Actions tab for successful execution
